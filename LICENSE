Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other
practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change
the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to
make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software
Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can
apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech,"
not as in "free beer."  Freedom means the absence of barriers to sharing
and changing the software.  To protect your rights, we need to prevent
others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.

Therefore, you have the freedom to:
  * Share your software with others
  * Modify your software so that it can be adapted to your needs
  * Share your modifications with others
  * Use your software in private, as long as you donâ€™t distribute it
    (Note that this has implications for use and redistribution in
    case of software used in hardware, as well as distributing the source
    code or modifying it)

Each of these freedoms is important, but to exercise your freedom fully,
you must follow certain restrictions.  This License explains these freedoms
in detail and provides important protections.

                    Terms and Conditions

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor mask designs.

  "The Program" refers to any work covered by this License.  Each licensee
  is addressed as "you."

  "The Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, the source code
  includes all the source code for all modules it contains and any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the executable.

  "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

  1. You may copy, modify, distribute, and/or sublicense the Program,
  provided that you meet the following conditions:

    1.1. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
    1.2. You must keep intact all the copyright notices, terms and
    conditions from the source code and the license itself.

    1.3. You must provide the source code, either as part of the
    distribution or via a free and accessible URL.

  2. If you distribute the Program or its modifications, you must:
    
    2.1. Include a copy of the GNU General Public License with your
    distribution.

    2.2. If the Program is modified, you must include prominent notices
    stating that you have changed the files, along with the date of any
    change.

  3. You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
  granted by this License.

  4. You may not use the name of the Free Software Foundation or the names
  of its contributors for promotional purposes without written permission.

  5. If you distribute or publish the Program, or any modified version of
  it, you must do so under this License.

  6. If you modify the Program and distribute your modifications, you may
  license your modifications under terms that are compatible with this
  License, but you may not impose any additional restrictions that prevent
  others from using or distributing the Program under the same terms.

  7. If you distribute the Program in object code or executable form, you
  must accompany it with the corresponding source code or make it available
  under the same terms.

  8. If you use the Program in a manner that constitutes "tivoization" (i.e.,
  locking or disabling the use of modified versions), you may not impose
  such restrictions.

  9. If you redistribute the Program, you may do so under different terms
  than those outlined in this License, provided you ensure that the
  rights under this License are preserved.

  10. This License does not grant you any rights to use trademarks
  associated with the Program.

  11. Warranty Disclaimer: This Program is distributed without any warranty,
  expressed or implied.  See the GNU General Public License for the full
  disclaimer.

  12. Liability Disclaimer: No party shall be held liable for any damages
  or costs arising from the use of this Program.

  13. Termination: If you violate the terms of this License, your rights
  under it will be terminated.

  14. Interpretation: This License is governed by the law of the United
  States and any other applicable laws.
